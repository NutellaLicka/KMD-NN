# KMD-NN
I will use this repo to list relevant KMD NN activities, in order to provide more transparency to KMD voters. If you have any questions, hit me up on the [Komodo Discord](https://komodoplatform.com/discord) (@NutellaLicka#4241), or email me at minethechain@protonmail.com.

#### [My KMD NN Proposal](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/edit/master/notarynodes/nutellalicka/)

#### Region: Southern Hemisphere

## Information Updates
Unfortunately, unlike I proposed, I was only able to get my server located in Melbourne, Australia. This seems to be having a negative affect on my notarising ability, due to the ping to other nodes throughout the world. It is a known issue of iguana that the worse the connectivity/ping, the less likely you will participate in notarisations. This issue is being worked on by iguana devs, albeit slowly.

During the year, I had to close my KMD ecosystem mining pool, minethechains.com. I had my pool running for just under a year, until Nov 19. Unfortunately it was being heavily underutilised and cost quite a bit to continute to run. I believe my funds and time were best allocated toward other parts of the ecosystem.

I have been an active member of the KMD community and have been accessible and swiftly updated my node for every major KMD update. I have been amongst the first NN's to add coins to the dPoW mechanism when needed.

## Community Fund
As commited in my NN proposal, I have been putting 15% of my NN mining rewards towards community project donations. Below are the details of my donations, with specific details of each. I realised I wasn't donating the full 15% up until Dec 19 and rectified the issue with another payment (the 5% I had missed for those months).

I have been donating not only my time, but also my NN funds, towards the KMD community project, CHIPS. This fund is being used to fund CHIPS related development, such as a GUI, and backend development. You can find out more information about CHIPS at their [discord](https://discord.gg/SQCSa2X).

I hope this provides KMD ecosystem members with a clearer picture of what I have been up to, and how I have been contributing, whilst a KMD Notary Node. If you are considering who to vote for in future KMD NN elections, please take this information into account.
