## Information Updates 

As a way to further Komodo platform adoption, I have founded the project [Tokel](https://tokel.io). The Tokel Platform aims to be the best decentralized token platform on offer. The Tokel Platform will build a solid foundation, using existing Komodo Technologies, for token projects to launch and succeed from. This will be done through the creation of end-to-end token solutions for fixed supply and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This includes everything from the blockchain architecture, the information, assistance and open-sourced applications for projects and businesses looking to capitalize on token economics or token applications. Projects will be able to use streamlined token creation processes, have token explorer and wallet integrations, immediately trade on the decentralized exchange and utilize the NFT marketplace.

I will further Komodo technology education and adoption through my efforts on Tokel. Tokel will directly showcase and improve Komodo technologies. This project is a direct result of the education and funding I received through being voted in as a KMD NN for the past few seasons. I will continue to dedicate my time to improving the ecosystem as a whole.

## Community Donation Fund
In past years, I had been committing 15% of the NN mining rewards to community projects as donations. In S5, I once again committed to donationg community projects and initiatives. This season I will be donating 10% of the NN mining rewards. Below are the details of my donations, with specific details of each.

I have been donating not only my time, but also my NN funds, towards the KMD community project, CHIPS. 

I have recently started donating funds towards improving Komodo ecosystem based media content. You can find details below.

#### CHIPS donation details - 4777.05 KMD
I have donated a total of 4777.05 KMD to the CHIPS multi-sig donation fund over multiple seasons. You can find details for S4 at the bottom of this page. This fund is being used to fund CHIPS related development, such as a GUI, and backend development. You can find out more information about CHIPS at their [discord](https://discord.gg/SQCSa2X).

#### Media creation initiative - 838.99 KMD
I have decided to branch out to try and spur innovation and help incubate different aspects of the Komodo ecosystem. This season, I will be donating to the community contributor @ejuliano to produce video and audio content on everything Komodo community related. This media takes a dedicated amount of time and effort to produce. Ejuliano has been doing this off his own back, with no expectation of anything in return. I believe the initiative shown to produce such content without expectation is worthy of recognition. These donation funds are a token of my appreciation for his efforts and to assist in developing further content.

You can find his content at the [Komodo Unofficial Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyeJPBxjumDsJct6VuuAD0Q/playlists)

Cheers,

NutellaLicka

## Information Updates Archive
Unfortunately, unlike I proposed, I was only able to get my server located in Melbourne, Australia. This seems to be having a negative affect on my notarising ability, due to the ping to other nodes throughout the world. It is a known issue of iguana that the worse the connectivity/ping, the less likely you will participate in notarisations. This issue is being worked on by iguana devs, albeit slowly.

During the year, I had to close my KMD ecosystem mining pool, minethechains.com. I had my pool running for just under a year, until Nov 19. Unfortunately it was being heavily underutilised and cost quite a bit to continute to run. I believe my funds and time were best allocated toward other parts of the ecosystem.

I have been an active member of the KMD community and have been accessible and swiftly updated my node for every major KMD update. I have been amongst the first NN's to add coins to the dPoW mechanism when needed.
